        <p class="tag paragraph">Hypothesis:</p>
        <br />
        "Crypto Stablecoin Payments: Distribution x Distribution"
      </h3>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
         Pre-requisites (these are all likely IMO):
        <ul>
        <li>
          Stablecoins on crypto rails take over payments & remittances (easier than physical cash, faster & cheaper than credit cards/ ACH/ wires, etc)
        </li>
        <li>
          Stablecoin UX improves (it will, there's too much money on the line)
        </li>
        <li>
          Reasonable stablecoin regulation for crypto networks across globe (banks won't want to give this market up but will be forced to; some banks will acquire the infrastructure to compete and become players here, too)
         </li>
         <li>
          Bitcoin's value prop as "digital gold" doesn't suddenly switch to payments as Satoshi envisioned (this was already decided when BCASH & "big blockers" lost many years ago & it doesn't yet have a viable ZK L2; by the time it has viable ZK L2 for payments the network effects of players below will be too strong, plus Bitcoin is too volatile for day-to-day purchases -- Bitcoin is not a good unit of account -- and local users will demand conversion to stablecoins or local currency which will require addt'l transaction fees).
        </li>
        </ul>
      </h4>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        Given the above, there are two categories of distribution that matter for stablecoin payment players competing in an open market:
        <ol>
        <li> Distribution, as in Market Penetration: access to merchants & end-users. <br />
            Critical factors:
            <ul>
              <li> Crypto wallet infrastructure & UX</li>
              <li>Merchant preference & UX</li>
              <li>Cross-chain penetration</li>
            </ul>
            All will take time to get right.
        </li>
        <li>
        Distribution, of a Token or Equity among stakeholders that accrues value of stablecoin cash flows:
          <ul>
            <li>transaction fees</li>
            <li>US Treasury yields of underlying dollars</li>
          </ul>
      </h4>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        Paypal ($PYUSD) vs. Coinbase+Circle ($USDC) vs. Stripe+Bridge (TBD) vs. Visa vs. &lt;fill in the blank&gt;
        <br /><br />
        The winner(s) will be the leader(s) in both categories of Distribution, or will be so strong in one category that they out-compete the leader in the other. Merchants, end-users, & other stakeholders will prefer a payments system that they have a stake in or can earn yeield from. We may see a situation where a stablecoin wins for a little while early in this race on the merit of 1/ but is ultimately overtaken due to 2/. Payment providers using stablecoins will also have to compete on terms such as chargebacks, bankruptcy provisions, etc.
      </h4>
      <p class="paragraph">
        In emerging free markets, 2/ will enable crypto stablecoin payments to out-compete digital payment systems that don't offer value accrual to stakeholders and/or end-users (ex: WeChat, Tether as it exists today). Network effects will compound this. But there will probably always be a market for payments with ultra-low-to-no fees & no terms at all in these markets (ex: Tether on Tron probably won't change much and will get a ton of usage for a while).
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Understanding these tradeoffs will be the work of institutional risk analysts. Matt Taibbi has already called out Circle publicly for their somewhat vague and terrible bankruptcy terms.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        You can bet on the payment providers or the underlying infrastructure that you anticipate they'll have to pay to use to reach end-users. You could also bet on any exchange with stablecoin pairs where market makers & other participants are likely to do large volumes.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Decentralized stablecoins are a dead-end. At least for US dollars. The Fed and regulatory apparatus has zero appetite for a new crypto eurodollar market that they can't impose censorship on. Sometimes i wonder if Do Kwon & SBF's excess was stoked by entities with a vested interest in demonstrating massive, memorable failures for the public.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Could see a stablecoin emerge that contains a basket of currencies; something like the original Libra Diem vision but not controlled by an entity like Facebook that is perceived as evil.
      </p>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        Risks:
        <ul>
          <li>Mr Robot's E-Coin: Politician who promises "blockchain innovation" really means "E-Coin" on private bank blockchain rails, everything else becomes illegal.
          </li>
          <li>Kwonification: One of these crypto stables blows up, has terrible or zero bankruptcy terms and many people are harmed. Which is why decent regulation is a pre-requisite here.
          </li>
          <li>US CDBC: A variation where E-Coin's backend is the US Fed. Some politicians think this is a great idea. I doubt this gets traction politically in the US, plus its a stretch for the US government to develop something so multi-layered and technical in a timely manner. But if they were clever and engineered an emergency where they had to airdrop dollars, everyone would of course download the app or wallet and/or exchanges providers might be compelled to integrate it. Very long-term I could see a US CDBC living alongside other stablecoins with programmable features like "only valid for food", etc.
          </li>
        </ul>

          It is the price tag for securing value with network effects."
      </h3>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        <ul>
        <li>Institutions cannot trust crypto networks whose 1/ cost to attack is too low and 2/ level of decentralization is too low. Nobody wants to put a Billion dollars of AUM on a network secured by a dozen or so of SBF's friends dumping its native token on each other. Especially if the circulating market cap of the network is lower than said AUM. You wouldn't put the Hope Diamond in a gym locker.
        </li>
        <li>Economic security is NOT just a meme (unless your blockchain is full of worthless meme coins, in which case-- yes, it is just a meme).</li>
        <li>Various blockchain/ ledger designs will eventually converge; the difference in the meantime will be in the tradeoffs chosen (level of decentralization, security, execution speed, scaling, etc) and what sequence these tradeoffs are delivered in.</li>
        <li>Ultimately it will be economic security (cost to attack the network x AUM/ liquidity x level of decentralization) that will determine the adoption curve for institutional players from TradFi looking to secure millions/ billions in AUM.</li>
        <li>Every crypto cycle will have one or more new "darling" layer1 networks that will get a foothold by choosing a different sequence of tradeoffs from Ethereum. But bc they will be behind in economic security, the users & use-cases will be transient locusts hopping from one new chain to the next until one of them achieves an escape velocity in terms of economic security (most won't, but it also won't matter for layer1's specialized in gaming, AI, energy or another theme that doesn't need to secure $Billions in AUM).</li>
        <li>Economic security is the price tag for securing value at scale with network effects.</li>
        </ul>
      </h4>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        Risks:
        <ul>
        <li>Ethereum ecosystem must deliver a solution to layer2 liquidity fragmentation or it risks being overtaken eventually, but that's likely coming in the form of Polygon AggLayer and/or OP Superchain or some solution at the base layer. Much of the value proposition of using a blockchain is in accessing its accumulated AUM/ liquidity, which reinforces the network effect. Web3 blockchains may prove to have even stronger network effects than web2 social networks.</li>
        <li>Eventually a layer2's own token might pump such that its circulating market cap far exceeds its AUM, in which case it may not need ETH economic security or liquidity anymore. This is likely to happen, many times. Ethereum might function as a sort of stellar nursery, where small networks grow over time & eventually break off.</li>
        <li>If not enough of the value of its layer2's filters back up to the Ethereum base chain token holders, the market cap of Ethereum may shrink.</li>
        <li>This could be solved by coupling ETH with its layer2's more tightly. Either by raising the fees the layer2's pay in ETH or making them stake ETH on the base chain in order to access its network effect. There's probably other clever ways to more deeply couple layer1 ETH and layer2 economic value that i just haven't thought of.</li>

        Although Ethereum has the most significant network effect of any blockchain network, it still doesn't have a proper social graph that can be used to bootstrap an open social network. The roadblocks have been significant -- Layer 1 is expensive & not scalable. Layer 2's present the opportunity to finally create a user-owned/ user-controlled social network based on open blockchain data that is scalable & cheap. Other cheaper blockchains or alternatives might pop up in the future but i dont currently see any with enough network effects (maybe Solana at its peak via STEPN etc lol but that's over for now due to Sam and Solana will struggle in shadows for a while). Network effects are powerful in social and it will be hard to play catch-up.

        An open social graph like like this is a pre-requisite to making consumer/ social crypto happen.

      <h2>Q1 2023</h2>
      <h3>
        <p class="tag paragraph">Hypothesis:</p>
        <br />
        "Blue chip DeFi & DEX Emerge from the bear market"
      </h3>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        Brutal bear market leads to consolidation, much like 2000's era of internet startups. What are the Amazons and Googles that will emerge as winners of crypto?
      </h4>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        <ul>
          <li>DEX: FTX collapse has perfectly and memorably articulated the case for DEX.</li>
          <li>DeFi: Transparent on-chain money markets. SBF paid back his DeFi loans first.</li>
          <li>CeDeFi: Centralized stablecoins, censorable & backed by US Treasuries (Tether not going anywhere tho, it is too useful to powerful actors in gray markets around the world). CEX'es also have incredible opportunity to harness defi for the masses, with buttery UX & regulatory compliance. DEX & CEX will eventually converge (Coinbase stock not a bad hedge here).</li>
        </ul>
      </h4>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        Winners:
        <ul>
          <li>Uniswap, 0x, Aave, Curve Finance, Coinbase as hedge.</li>
        </ul>
      </h4>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        Concerns:
        <ul>
          <li>Unclear how $UNI token captures value of protocol, esp w equity shares in the mix (token holders vs. equity holders).</li>
          <li>$AAVE might be in a similar situation, only from opposite direction (are they issuing equity for private money market products?).</li>
          <li>$CRV is pursuing decentralized stablecoin, and either way is the most used DEX for stablecoins, the use-case for crypto with most PMF (regulatory risk: big gov & tradfi hate decentralized stablecoin, could engineer a Luna-like crash). $CRV also has big token unlocks in 2023.</li>
        </ul>
      </h4>

      <h3>
        <p class="tag paragraph">Hypothesis:</p>
        <br />
        "Modular app-chains on Cosmos"
      </h3>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        DYDX chose to move to Cosmos rather than Ethereum layer 2. Probably bc using an app chain solves problems of security, MEV, general value extraction by the underlying blockchain infra. $DYDX token used for infra layer also means more decentralization of protocol. Theirs is Orderbook model with off-chain orders stored in-memory by validators of sovreign blockchain made possible by flexibility of Cosmos SDK. More projects will choose Cosmos for this reason, plus ability to use their app-token for sovreign security on own chain. Upgrades to Cosmos that allow security to be "rented" from larger cross-chain network will accelerate trend.
      </h4>

      <h3>
        <p class="tag paragraph">Hypothesis:</p>
        <br />
        "3-digit $ETH following Beacon Chain unlock in March 2023"
      </h3>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        Shanghai update in March will unlock Beacon Chain stakers who have been patiently waiting. Ethereum will undergo temporary sell pressure from this one-time momentous event and tumble down into 3-digits before recovering. Be patient. Long-term $ETH becomes deflationary and crosses 5-digits in the next bull run (2024-2025). There will be at least one disaster with a liquid staking derivative (LSD) token.
      </h4>

      <h3>
        <p class="tag paragraph">Hypothesis:</p>
        <br />
        "A Web 3 social network arrives (finally)"
      </h3>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        A hypothesis with -- perhaps -- a long time horizon. The biggest question here is: Will it emerge from Web2 co's that embrace crypto ("outside-in", Ex: Reddit, Starbucks, Twitter?), or from crypto-native organizations/protocols that finally get as much traction as a Web2 co. ("inside-out", Ex: Lens, Farcaster, art/music NFTs). Perhaps they converge, similar to CEX & DEX. Arguably, the NFT communities on Ethereum base layer are already a proto-social network of their own. But that world still lacks fundamental infra (Ex: over-reliance on Discord).
      </h4>

      <h3>
        <p class="tag paragraph">Hypothesis:</p>
        <br />
        "AI & blockchains converge"
      </h3>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        Also longer time horizon. Decentralized storage archives like IPFS ($FIL) & TheGraph ($GRT) become training ground for AI, which accelerates but faces regulatory backlash around copyright. Data unions finally emerge that compensate creators for recombinant works produced by AI based on their originals. This seemed obvious years ago but AI has finally caught up. Tokenized machine-to-machine payments facilitate autonomous machine learning in these playgrounds. Integration with something like Neuralink or even a sophisticated wearable AR/VR creates cyborg humans capable of learning Kung Fu like Neo in The Matrix.
      </h4>
      <h4 class="paragraph">
        Potential local headwind here could be if China invades Taiwan and there is a semiconductor crisis that hamstrings progress via supply chain disruption.
